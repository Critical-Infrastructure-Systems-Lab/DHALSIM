The objective of this attack was to empty tank1 through a MiTM attack.

These is a sister attack, the sister would be tank7_overflow_exponential

The objective of the attack is to have an offset that gradually causes T7 to overflow.

This attack was dropped because the overflow option did not worked as expected
Later we found a bug in the attack script, so perhaps it could be a good idea to launch it again
