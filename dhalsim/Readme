Limitations of general

- Is only supporting one type of network topology. (Either complex or simple)
- We are writing the utils file. Is there a better way of doing this?
- The general topology (I think) is not supporting initial tank levels, or demamnd patterns
- The PLCs of general topology cannot implement attacks
- The SCADA server is not implemented topology
- The automatic_run process of general topology (general_automatic_run) does not support launching attack processes
- The physical process of general topology does not support launching attacks
- The attack_descriptions.yaml file present in the directory /attack_repository/ are not supported by the general
