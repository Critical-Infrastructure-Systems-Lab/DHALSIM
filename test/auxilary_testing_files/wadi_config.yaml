# Network simulation parameters
# True in complex topology means that each PLC is in its own LAN; NAT and port forwarding is used to connect the LAns
# in a start topology. This uses the mininet topology described in simple_topo.py
# False in complex topology means that all the PLCs are in the same LAN. This uses the mininet topology describes in
# complex_topo.py

# Simulation type. Supported values now are "Single" and "Batch"
# A single simulation runs only once. Possibly using the customization values as defined by initial_custom_flag
# In single simulations, the week_index parameter is read from this config file
# A Batch simulation runs consecutive weeks. Batch simulation requires that the initial_custom_flag is set to true
# and that the demand paths are correctly set. Batch simulations takes the week_index parameter for sys.argv. Hence,
# the responsibility of passing this parameter to general_automatic_run.py is on the calling script

# Run attack. Possible values:
# - True
# - False
# This flag indicates whether or not the attacks should be executed.
# Using this flag also requires specifying the attack file
